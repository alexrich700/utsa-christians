                    Hey, I'm a junior at UTSA majoring in Art.
                    </br>
                    Entering college the Lord told me to find friends who share the same faith as I do. 
                    I agreed with the Lord and made a goal for myself: to find a christian club, because that would be the best way to connect with other Christians. 
                    By the grace of God, I found this group during my orientation. Ever since then, I quickly found my place in this club. 
                    Seeing that I was able to meet all brothers and sisters in Christ who come from all different backgrounds made me ecstatic. 
                    The fact that this group took really good care of me warmed my heart and revealed to me that this is what Christian life is all about: the caring, the fellowship, the praying, just to name a few!
                    </br>
                    I recommend anyone who is open to Christian fellowship to join Christian Students on Campus at UTSA. 
                    They won't regret it! I thank the Lord for finding this club and the memories that I have made with them so far!

                    I'm an alumna at UTSA. Prior to meeting Christian Students on Campus at UTSA I always had questions concerning the Lord Jesus and the Christian faith. 
                    On my first day of classes, I saw a big "Christ is Life" banner hanging on a table at the club fair in the Student Union, and couldn't help but approach them. 
                    That was the best decision I made in my life. 
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    During my time in college, Christian Students on Campus was my gateway to a genuine Christian life. 
                    The bible studies ignited and gradually strengthened my faith in the word and the Lord. 
                    And the club connected me to a community of believers whose living impressed wad encouraged me to love the Lord more. Even after graduation, I'm still reaping the benefits of being with the group. 
                    Praise the Lord!

                    Hey everyone, I am a recent graduate of UTSA. I received the Lord Jesus into my heart during my senior year in high school school  and found the meaning of my human life. 
                    I made the decision to keep pursuing God while in college. Upon arriving at UTSA I connected with Christian Students on campus and found a group that helped me grow in my daily Christian walk. 
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Attending bible studies and getting together with other students to talk about Jesus strengthend my faith and encouraged me to speak to others about God. 
                    Through this time in college I gained many experiences with God that will keep me pursuing.

                    Hi! I’m an alumnus from UTSA, my major was electrical engineering and I graduated in 2012. 
                    </br>
                    I grew up in Peru going to some church meetings every now and then, pretty much only when my uncle would take me. 
                    When I moved to San Antonio with my family, we went to church meetings more regularly but then we got busy with life and forgot all about it. 
                    In my high school years, I felt like I was the only believer among my classmates since I was the only one that would talked about God here and there. So I kind of felt alone. 
                    Sometimes I read the Bible and also I would get inspired to talk to God but I was never consistent. However, I did get help from those times and got closer to God. 
                    Then as my high school years were coming to a close, there were some tragedies of some family friends and at the end of it all my grandma’s death happened right on my graduation night. 
                    These situations led me to question life and to wonder what the purpose of my life was. 
                    </br>
                    When I came to UTSA, something came to my heart: I need other believers to help me to pursue the Lord and survive as a Christian. 
                    Then, I met Christian Students on Campus at UTSA as a freshman in my second semester. I began to read the Word with brothers and because of that my love for the Lord increased as well. 
                    In this group I realized that God doesn’t want me to do anything for Him except to give myself to love Him. 
                    I remained with the club till I graduated and in during those years I came to learn what the purpose of my life was. 
                    God’s purpose is that He wants us to love Him and be filled with Him! This echoed in my heart.
                    </br>
                    Song of Songs 1:4 Draw me; we will run after You.
                    </br>
                    I'm now a member of the staff of Christian Students on Campus at UTSA. I look forward to running after the Lord together with students who love the Lord! 

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    As long as I can remember, I had believed in God, but like many I struggled with many inner conflicts and worries. 
                    Coming to UTSA was a brand new start for me since it gave me a chance to get away from all the bad memories I had in the Rio Grande Valley. 
                    The only good thing left, at least in my eyes, was my mother, and I could always go back to visit. Still, I wasn’t content to simply run away from bad experiences; rather,
                    God had put it in my heart to find others who were seeking Him, so I trusted Him to bring me to them. 
                    The university held a “religious fair” in the Student Union (known as the University Center at the time) where all the religious clubs could present themselves. 
                    It was there that I found a humble little group called Christian Students on Campus, and I had agreed to meet with them. 
                    Soon after God had a breakthrough in my heart and I realized just how serious He was about bringing me together with other Christians. 
                    The brothers provided me with security and guidance, often visiting me right in my dorm (Chaparral) to read the Bible with me and help me grow in my faith. 
                    They would even invite me and other new students to meet in their homes. Now, the university has some decent food, but nothing beats a home-cooked meal with friends. 
                    Even store-bought pizza tastes better among friends. In those homes, I felt free to sing and laugh and pray and read the Bible with other believers, and it was awesome. 
                    It still is. 
                    </br>
                    I feel like I’ve grown so much with them and the other believers, and despite being caught off-guard by how much more I have to go, 
                    it’s exciting to think I can go even further in my walk with God.

                   I met Christian students on Campus when I was a sophomore on campus about 7 years ago, and it has been one of the greatest things I could have ever done! 
                   The style was a little different than any previous Christian club I had met with, 
                   but from the start I realized that the members in Christian Students on Campus really loved Christ and really sought to get into the Word in a deeper way. 
                   I had a lot of questions about the Lord even growing up as a believer, and the staff and students of the club really took the time to not only try to answer my questions, 
                   but to also get to know me as a person. 
                   </br>
                   This club was smaller than previous clubs I had met with, 
                   but that ended up being very helpful for me because I didn't feel drowned out, and I had a tight-knit group that I could both pursue the Lord and be myself with.
                   </br>
                   I met with Christian Students on Campus throughout the rest of my college career, and when I graduated I went on to attend a two year Bible and church service program. 
                   Upon completion of this program, I came back to UTSA to be a staff member for Christian Students on Campus, 
                   and I can honestly say that it was just as helpful in my Christian life then as it was when I was a student! 
                   I am pursuing a different career path now, but I still attend as many events as I can, and I still love being part of this group! 
                   I'm truly grateful for this group of people who not only walk the Christian life with me, but who have also become some of my closest and dearest friends.
